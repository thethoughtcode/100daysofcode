        <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
        <ul class="timeline">
          <li><span class="year">1914</span>Bord in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1933</span>Leaves his family's farm to attend the
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as

          <li>
            <span class="year">1935</span>Has to stop school and save up more
            money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how food chang them", he said. "All of this left
            scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1937</span>Finishes university and takes a job in
            the US Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1938</span>Marries wife of 69 years Margret
            Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
            Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
            about breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1941</span>Tries to enroll in the military after
            the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
            asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
            disinfectants, and other applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1942</span>Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
            Pathology

          <li>
            <span class="year">1944</span>Rejects a 100% salary increase from
            Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head
            a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team
            breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
            including different varities of each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1945</span>Discovers a way to grow wheat twice
            each season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1953</span>crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of
            wheat with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that
            responds well to fertilizers. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
            wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1962</span>Visits Delhi and brings his
            high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to
            help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
          </li>
          <li><span class="year">1970</span>receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="year">1984</span>becomes a distinguished professor at
            Texas A&amp;M University

          <li>
            <span class="year">2005</span>states "we will have to double the
            world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
            are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
            land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
            been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li><span class="year">2009</span>dies at the age of 95.</li>

            contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
            scientific vision can make to human peace and progress.
